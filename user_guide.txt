The doctor,after examining the patient, can write the prescription in the space provided and save the prescription by clicking on the save icon. 
The doctor can also print the prescription by clicking on the print icon. In order to print a prescription, the doctor must first save the prescription. Also, if the doctor changes the prescription after saving it, he must save it again if he wants to print the changed prescription otherwise, the previous prescription itself will get printed. 
Since printing is done using google cloud print, it is mandatory that either the doctor or the clinic has a google email ID and also there is a printer present in the clinic which has been registered with the corresponding google ID on google cloud print.
